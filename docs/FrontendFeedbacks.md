As an engineer, this is my first time using ICP. The development process is very different from most existing networks such as EVM, apart from that there is not much information in the community and existing wallet extension support makes the integration process quite difficult. Here's a breakdown to consider:

## Pros
- Enhanced Security: ICPs enforce strong authentication methods, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Improved User Experience: ICPs streamline the login process by leveraging existing user credentials from trusted providers.
- Simplified Compliance: ICPs can help ensure compliance with regulations related to user identity and data privacy.
- Reduced Development Time: By utilizing pre-built ICP components, developers can save time and effort compared to building their own authentication systems from scratch.

## Cons
- Limited Browser Support: Not all browsers have native support for wallet extensions, potentially excluding users who rely on them for login or identity verification.
- Security Concerns: Integrating with third-party wallet extensions introduces additional attack vectors. Carefully evaluate the security posture of the chosen wallet extension and implement robust security measures.
- User Experience Complexity: Using wallet extensions for login can add an extra step to the user login flow, potentially impacting user experience.
- Limited Feature Set: Wallet extension functionalities might not perfectly align with your application's specific needs for user identity and data management.
